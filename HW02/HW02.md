## REST API

<a id="org5ebfa67"></a>

### What is REST API?

REST API (which should actually be called RESTful API) means Representational State Transfer (REST) application program interface (API). It was originally defined in Roy Fielding's PhD dissertation "Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures". It should be noted that, unlike SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), which is a protocol itself, REST is not a standard, but an architectual style.

1.  Features

    Now that REST is a style, what are the key features of the style? The following seven points are listed in Wikipedia:

    - performance (the dominant factor)
    - scalability (allowing to supports lots of components and interactions)
    - simplicity (of uer interface)
    - modifiability (of components)
    - visibility (of communication)
    - portability (of components)
    - reliability (in resistance to failure)

      Personally, I think the success of RESTful API should be attributed to its comprehensibility. In most use cases, the operations GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE each correspond to a specific type of data manipulation (CRUD) of either a collection or an element, which is easy to understand.

2.  Constraints

    There are six guiding constraints which should generally be obeyed:

    - Client-server (C/S) architecture
    - Statelessness
    - Cacheability
    - Layered system
    - Code on demand
    - Uniform interface

### Why REST API?

REST API has dominated

- It is very comprehensible (which has been mentioned above).
- It decouples the link between consumers and producers. Note that a "consumer" here does not necessarily mean a real user or buyer, for REST API is used inside one product or one corporation much more frequently than offered directly to users or other corporations.
- It is stateless, which is important for cloud-native applications, e.g., docker, kubernetes, cloud functions (lambda). Of course it does not mean that cloud-native does not support stateful applications, but they will require much more consideration.
- It is able to introduce the cache effect helping our search and digital data storage‚
- It introduces a fully layered system‚
- It is easy to develop, and also to test a RESTful API, especially with the help of systems like [Swagger](https://swagger.io/).

### Why not REST API?

REST API has come into being for nearly 20 years. As we all know, there are few architectures or standards which can live as long as or longer than 20 years in the field of Internet Technology. As has been discussed above, REST API is good, but not so good. There are three major problems:

- When we need multiple types of data, e.g., users, posts, groups and so on, to be rendered in a view, we need to make multiple requests to a REST API server, which can actually be annoying and troublesome.
- The shape, size and other properties of requests are generally defined by the server, leaving little flexibility for the client side. For example, when the client only needs certain fields, like "name" of "users", it still needs to request "GET /users", and receive all other fields besides "name".
- REST API is not so friendly to front-end developers.

### GraphQL v.s. REST API

Then GraphQL comes. It is indeed a language.

> You have a client and a server and both of them need to talk with each other. The client needs to tell the server what data it needs, and the server needs to fulfill this clientâ€™s data requirement with actual data. GraphQL steps into the middle of this communication. &#x2013; Samer Buna

As Samer Buna said, GraphQL works between the client and the server. It brings about great flexibility on the client side. The data consumer can customize requests to fit its needs. No need for multiple round trips for a complex data structure. No need for unnecessary data transport when only part of all properties are required.

GraphQL is still young.(Not so young if the years during which Facebook developed it internally are counted.) It is kind of challenging for back-end developers, whereas new tools have been mushrooming. Maybe REST API will rest in peace in a few years, but it is not that soon in my opinion.
